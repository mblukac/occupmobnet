# occupmobnet
## Occupational Mobility Network in Europe

A project aiming to reconstruct occupational mobility networks for European labour markets. Project commenced in **October 2019** and first results will follow soon!

_Use note:_
We used data from EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) and EU Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS). Each dataset is loaded and analysed separately—files `ocm_eusilc.R` and `ocm_lfs.R` shall be used on respective datasets. Unfortunately, both datasets are subject to licensing from the authorities. To obtain these datasets, contact Eurostat: [LFS](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/microdata/european-union-labour-force-survey) and [EU-SILC](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/microdata/european-union-statistics-on-income-and-living-conditions).
